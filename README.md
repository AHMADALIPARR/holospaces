## Notes

- The `just-gherkin-fortran/` directory contains the extracted contents of the provided `just-gherkin-fortran.zip` unchanged.
- Rust and other language snippets are placed in `algorithms/` as standalone files matching the original paste boundaries.
- All mathematical lemmas, certificate chain definitions, proof obligations, and novelty assessments remain in the original prose form under `docs/`.
- No new code was invented; no existing code was modified, corrected, or substituted.
- Build and execution of the Fortran stack follows the `justfile` recipes provided in the extracted project.

## Original Sources

- Pasted markdown/text containing mixed algorithms and mathematics
- `just-gherkin-fortran.zip` (extracted and placed under `just-gherkin-fortran/`)

All claims remain traceable to the authoritative sources referenced in the original material. Deduplication metrics are engineering measurements only.

## OpenQASM 3 Addition

The OpenQASM 3 circuit, Klong angle array, hand-written C state-vector simulator, and zero-dependency Rust recursive-descent parser have been organized under:

```
openqasm/
├── examples/
│   ├── custom_circuit.qasm     # H-Rz-CNOT-Rz-CNOT circuit (OpenQASM 3)
│   └── angles.kg               # Klong :array[157 314] (milliradians)
├── c_simulator/
│   └── simulator.c             # Minimal verifiable state-vector simulator (C)
└── rust_parser/
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── Justfile
    └── src/main.rs             # Hand-written recursive-descent parser
```

All files were extracted verbatim from the provided paste. No code was edited or substituted.

## Production Kernels

Full production implementations that complete the earlier skeletons are under `production/`.
See `production/README.md` for build instructions. Original snippets remain unchanged in their original locations.

## Additional OpenQASM Circuits

Circuits modeled after the original snippets have been added under:

```
openqasm/examples/circuits/
├── ghz_rotations.qasm          # OpenQASM 2 GHZ + RX/RY/RZ (from compiler snippet)
├── holospaces_ht_cnot.qasm     # OpenQASM 3 H-T-CNOT chain (from benchmark loop)
├── parametric_entangler_3.qasm # 3-qubit extension of the parametric H-Rz-CNOT
├── bell.qasm                   # Minimal H-CNOT
└── custom_circuit_v2.qasm      # OpenQASM 2 rendering of the custom circuit
```

All are faithful structural models of the patterns present in the supplied code.
